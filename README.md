# Sonic 1 Retextured/Repainted
this is a ROM hack i made in late 2017 which never really went anywhere, so don't really expect much. it was basically just intended to be normal sonic 1 with a couple of new features and mostly new graphics

i don't remember making this specific version of the hack, so i have no clue when this is from

jsyk, this won't be continued
